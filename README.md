# WordClouds-Classification-Clustering
Purpose of this project is to use wordclouds to analyze data and use algorithms for classification and clustering

Algorithms for classification: 
-Support Vector Classifier(SVC)
-Random Forests
-Naive Bayes
-K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)

Algorithm for clustering:
-KMeans

For data visualization I use PCA
